# ToDo List

## Description
This is a little todo list that can take in input (new todos) from a user and add them to a todo list. The todos can be deleted and completed. Once completed they can be uncompleted (added back to the todo list) or deleted.
They can also now be updated with new items when they are not completed yet.

## Roadmap to Future Improvements
Next I would love to change up the check boxes to match the rest of the theme.
