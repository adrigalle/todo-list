# ToDo List

## Description
This is a little todo list that can take in input (new todos) from a user and add them to a todo list. The todos can be deleted and completed. Once completed they can be uncompleted (added back to the todo list) or deleted.

They cannot be updated yet, I am still figuring that one out. You can start to update it but I haven't added the functionality to update.
